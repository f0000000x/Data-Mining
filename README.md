Education as the ladder of human progress is an essential part of human civilization. 
Education affects every aspect of human society and is also influenced by it. 
As a beneficiary of education, I am very fortunate to be able to delve into what can affect education in this class.
I hope we can see the direction of what can make education better. In this project, 
I'm going to show you an overview of primary school enrollment worldwide; GDP and enrollment rates interact; 
Gender differences in enrollment and the relationship between education spending and enrollment.
